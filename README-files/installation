 . Installation

   To install Rage, call 'make install'. When installing Rage, it will
   be placed in the libnds package alongside the other include and lib
   files. So librage.a will be placed in $DEVKITPRO/libnds/lib and
   rage.h will be placed in $DEVKITPRO/libnds/include. $DEVKITPRO must
   be set to your devkitPro installation, but the Makefile will check
   that it is. Make sure that you have permission to write to your
   devkitPro installation.

   An alternative to installing Rage in libnds is to add the path to
   the Rage directory to the LIBDIRS line in the Makefile.

   To upgrade Rage, simply call 'make install', it will overwrite the
   currently installed Rage.
