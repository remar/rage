 . Introduction

   Rage is a graphics library for the Nintendo DS with a C++
   interface. It provides an abstraction for scrollable backgrounds
   with varying tile dimensions, animating sprites, and automatic
   palette merging. A general design consideration has been ease of
   use, so hopefully that has been accomplished. A gentle introduction
   to Rage is available on the Rage website:

   Happy hacking!
