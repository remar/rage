 . Introduction

   Rage is a graphics library for the Nintendo DS with a C++
   interface. It provides an abstraction for backgrounds with varying
   tile dimensions, and animating sprites. A general design
   consideration has been ease of use, so hopefully that has been
   accomplished. A gentle introduction to Rage is available on the
   Rage website: <http://remar.se/andreas/rage/tutorial.php>.

   Happy hacking!
