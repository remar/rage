 . Using Rage

   This is a minimalist source file that uses Rage. See the API
   documentation and examples to learn about the different methods,
   tileset definition, and sprite definition. Make sure that your
   source files are named .cpp as Rage is implemented in C++ and can
   only be linked into C++ projects. You don't have to use any other
   functionality of C++ than what Rage uses if you don't want to.

   #include "rage.h"

   int main()
   {
     Rage rage;

     rage.init();

     return 0;
   }

   To link with Rage you need to add -lrage to the LIBS line in the
   Makefile. This variable will by default list -lnds9, include -lrage
   before -lnds9. The LIBS line will then look like this:

   LIBS   := 	  -lrage -lnds9
