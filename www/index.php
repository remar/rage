So.. after a little downtime when it comes to coding I've started
again. When working on a little side project I found another bug in
Rage, so here's Rage 0.1.2! As always, you can find the new release on
the <a href="downloads.php">downloads</a> page.

I'm currently coding on something that actually uses Rage, so I've
been able to find some bugs! Both bugs were related to animating
sprites, and both are fixed. You can find a new release on the
<a href="downloads.php">downloads</a> page.

Rage is released to the world! After a month of work, here is finally
the first version of this C++ graphics library for Nintendo DS. See
the <a href="tutorial.php">tutorial</a> to learn how to use it, or see
the <a href="about.php">about page</a> to read about the features and
future of Rage.
